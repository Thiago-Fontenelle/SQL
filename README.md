# SQL
SQL practice and portfolio projects
This is a space where I share practice and personal projects working with SQL and databases. Here I'll share simple projects, either of my own fruition or influenced by free to use projects I find on the internet.
The main purpose for this repository is to serve as my portfolio on SLQ.

Welcome!
